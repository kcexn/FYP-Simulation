# Final Year Project 2018

This repository contains the simulation work I've done for my 
final year project 2018.

# Notes

The two key files that contain the important simulations 
are the files:

- ChannelModel_MeanSquareErrorMeasurements_Fixed.m
- ChannelModel_TimeVarying_Measurements.m

The rest are all supporting files and random experiments for learning.

Everything in these simulations has been developed from scratch excepting 
the use of the MATLAB communications systems toolbox.
